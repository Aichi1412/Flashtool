   Flashtool is a flashing software that can be used to : 
   <ol>
	<li>Flash original Images (Android 1.6, 2.1, 2.3 Images)
    <li>Root your phone
    <li>Install Recovery, Busybox, custom kernels
    <li>Clean your Rom (remove /system/apps apps of your choice) (Be careful, unless you really know what you do, do not modify the default list. This can make your phone stuck at the SE Logo)
    <li>Clear dalvik cache
    <li>Optimize (install of JIT v2) (Disabled in 0.4, will readd it as a plugin for 2.1 phones only)
    <li>Customize (installs apps found in the custom/apps folder of the flashtool)
    <li>Clean uninstalled (remove any references to system apps removed in the Clean (root needed) step)
    <li>Edit any text file on the device
    <li>Rebrand your device
   </li>
   </ol>

      while this Ask Root task is not complete.
[New] Firmwares have to come bundled in one file named with a ftf extension
      (ftf for Flash Tool Firmware). A Create Bundle feature has been added to the tool to create
